    <h2>1. Governance Foundation</h2>
    <p>
      Establishing a strong governance foundation ensures alignment across
      stakeholders, delivery teams, and sponsors. This includes defining
      governance objectives, roles, responsibilities, and decision authorities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clear ownership and escalation paths reduce ambiguity and ensure faster
      resolution of issues during execution.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Project Initiation Controls</h2>
    <p>
      Project initiation governance focuses on readiness validation before
      execution begins. This includes approval gates, kickoff checklists,
      baseline artifact validation, and stakeholder sign-offs.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Business case approval</li>
      <li>Scope and objectives sign-off</li>
      <li>Governance cadence setup</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Execution & Monitoring</h2>
    <p>
      Governance during execution ensures continuous oversight of scope, cost,
      schedule, quality, and risks. Regular governance forums help track
      progress and address deviations proactively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Metrics-driven reporting enables leadership to make informed decisions
      based on real-time data.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Closure & Continuous Improvement</h2>
    <p>
      Governance does not end with delivery. Closure activities include formal
      acceptance, lessons learned documentation, and audit closure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Continuous improvement initiatives ensure governance maturity across
      future projects.
